// Also add something they call an emission map which is a texture that stores emission values
// per fragment. Emission values are colors an object may emit as if it contains a light source
// itself; this way an object can glow regardless of the light conditions. Emission maps are
// often what you see when objects in a game glow (like the eyes of a robot, or light strips
// on a container). Add the following texture (by creativesam) as an emission map onto the
// container as if the letters emit light: learnopengl.com/img/textures/matrix.
